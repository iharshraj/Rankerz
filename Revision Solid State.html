    <h2>Amorphous and crystalline solids</h2>
    <li>Amorphous are <u>isotropic</u> and crystalline are <u>Anisotropic</u>.</li>
    <br><li>Crystallines have regular and consistent physical properties. </li>
    <br><li>Amorphoes (eg, glass, plastics) can flow but very slowly.</li>
    <br><li>There are four types of crystalline solids: Molecular , Ionic , Metallic and Covalent(or Network) Solids.</li>
    <br><li>Ionic solids form crystallines and they are bad conductors<br>of electricity (NaCl, in solid form) and they are brittle.</li>
    <br><li><b>Metallic solids > Ionic Solids</b> (for boiling and Melting Point) because Metallic solids <br>are held together with strong multi-directional electrostatic forces.</li>
    <br><li>In sample form ,<b>Covalent Solids > Ionic Solids</b> (for b.p and m.p) because ionic solids are present in blocks of lattices <br>which are easier to seperate than covalent solids which are held together with intermingled strong multi-directional covalent bonds</li>
    <br><li>In individual lattice form, <b>Covalent Solids < Ionic Solids</b> (for b.p and m.p) because Electrostatics force > Covalent </li>
        
    <h2>3-d lattices</h2>
    <img src="../files/images/bravais.jpg">
    <br><br><li>There are total 14 possible 3d lattices and they are known as <u>Bravais Lattices</u>.</li>
    <br><li><u>Primitive cells</u> are lattices in which lattice points are vertices of structure only.</li>
    <br><li><u>Non-primitive cells</u> are lattices in which lattice points are present at places other than vertices of structure too.
        <br> They are of 3 types : 
        <br> (i) BCC (body centered) 
        <br>(ii) FCC (Face centered), they are very common form due to high packing efficiency factor.
        <br>(iii)End Centered ,they are mostly present When a,b and c (side lengths) are not equal.</li>
    
    <br><li>Structures and their forms :-
        <br> <b>Cubic</b>: Simple(primitive) , BCC , FCC
        <br> <b>Tetragonal</b> : Simple , BCC
        <br> <b>Rhombohedral</b> : Simple , BCC , FCC ,End Centered
        <br> <b>Monoclinic</b> : Simple , End centered
        <br> <b>Triclinic</b> : Simple
        <br> <b>Hexagonal</b> : Simple
        <br> (Note that total number of forms = 14)
        </li>

    <br><li><b>Packing efficiency</b>= [Vol.(or area) occupied by atoms inside the cell] / [Vol.(or area) of unit cell]
    <br>FCC and HCP have highest Packing eff. about 74% </li>
    <br><li><b>Vol. of HCP(Hexagonal lattice)</b>= 24√2*(r)<sup>3</sup>
     , where "r" is radius of the atom.
    </li>
    <br><li><b>Cordination Number(C.N)</b>= No. of nearest surrounding atoms for any atom
        <br> for C.N , first select any convinient lattice point then 
        <br> C.N= (n*p)/k      , where
        <br> n = number of nearby atoms (anions) for the <i>selected</i> atom in a lattice
        <br>      p = potion of that atom in that cell (eg , for vertex lattice points p=1/8)
        <br>        k = number of cells it takes to completely cover the line segment that joins <i>selected</i> atom and its nearest neighbour.
    </li>
    <br><li>C.N for , Simple cell = 6
        , BCC = 8 , FCC = 12
    </li>
    
    <h3>ABAB and ABCABC packing</h3>
    <img class="packing" src="../files/images/ABAB and ABCABC packing.jpg" width="60%">
    <br><li>ABAB packing is shown by HCP and ABCABC is shown by FCC</li>
    <h2>Voids</h2>
    <li>Types of void :
        <br> <b>Trigonal Void</b>  (present only in 2d lattices)
        <br> <b>Tetrahedral Void</b> , equals to 2z (where, z = no. of complete atoms in a cell)
        <br> <b>Octahedral Void</b> , equals to z 
        <br> <b>Body Centered Void</b> , only in BCC and atmost 1.
    </li> <img src="../files/images/distance between tetrahedral voids.gif">
    <br><li>FCC = 4 oct and 8 tetra Voids
        <br>BCC = 2 oct and 4 tetra Voids
        <br>HCP = 6 oct and 12 tetra Voids
    </li>
    <br><li>Conditions for creation of voids , r+ means radius of cation and r- anion
        <br> 0.155 ≤ <sup>r+</sup>&frasl;<sub>r-</sub> < 0.225 , for Trigonal
        <br> 0.255 ≤ <sup>r+</sup>&frasl;<sub>r-</sub> < 0.414 , for Tetrahedral
        <br> 0.414 ≤ <sup>r+</sup>&frasl;<sub>r-</sub> < 0.732 , for Octahedral
        <br> 0.732 ≤ <sup>r+</sup>&frasl;<sub>r-</sub> < 1.000 , for Body Centered
    </li>
    <br>
    <h2>Types of Ionic Solids</h2>
    <li><b>NaCl Type</b>: Cations(+) fills all Octahedral positions in FCC
        <br>z = 4 (net atoms in one cell) 
        <br> dist of Closest cation and anion = <sup>a</sup>&frasl;2  (a=edge length)
        <br> r+ ≈ <sup>r-</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> 
    </li>
    
    <br><li><b>ZnS Type</b> : Cations(+) fill half of tetrahedral voids in FCC(in alternate form)
        <br> z = 4 , Closest dist b/w cation and anion is <sup>a√3</sup>&frasl;4
        
    </li>

    <br><li><b>CsCl Type</b> : Cation occupied Body Centered Void in BCC
            <br> z = 1 , Closest dist b/w cation and anion is <sup>(a√3)</sup>&frasl;2
            <br> r+ ≈ r-
    </li>
    <br><li><b>CaF<sub>2</sub> Type</b> : In these Fluorite structures (r+ > r-) (opp. of norm) , so cations(+) occupies lattice points instead.
            <br> and anions(-) occupies all tetrahedral voids in the lattice of FCC.
            <br> C.N of F<sup>-</sup> = 4 and , Ca<sup>2+</sup> = 8</li>
    <br><li><b>Na<sub>2</sub>O Type</b> : Its normal , Na<sup>+</sup> will fill all tetrahedral voids in FCC lattice.
            <br>C.N of Na<sup>+</sup> = 4 and , O<sup>2-</sup> = 8</li>

    <br><h2>Defects in Solids</h2>       
    <br><li>Defects in solids are of 2 types:- (a)Point defect and, (b)Line defect 
        <br> (a)<b>Point defect</b> : They are irregularities of points or atom arrangements in a cell.
        <br> (b)Line defect : They are irregularities in group of points in a substance.
    </li>
    <br><li>Point defects are of 3 types :
        <br>(i) <b>Stoichiometric defect</b>: ratio between cations and anions remains same
        <br>(ii) Impurity defect : Mixing of other elements in the solid (eg, duping) 
        <br>(iii) <b>Non-stoichiometric defect</b> : ratio between cations and anions changes
    </li>
    <br><li><b>Stoichiometric defects</b> can happen 2 ways :
    <br>    1) Vacancy defect : a lattice point being left vacant , this <u>decreases density</u>.It can occur when a subst. is heated.
    <br>    2) Interstitial defect : when an atom leaves their places and occupies interstitial spaces , this <u>increases density</u>.
    </li>
    <br><li>Ionic solids when undergoes stoichiometric defect they have to make sure the net neutrality of substance. 
        <br>They can undergo stoichiometric defect in 2 ways :-
        <br> (a) <b>Schottky defect</b> : Its a type of vacancy defect in <u>Ionic Solids</u> , in this defect cations and anions leave their sites in pair  
        <br> ,this <u>decreases density</u> of substance.It occurs when there not a significant difference in ionic radius of cations and anions.
        <br>Examples of solids showing this defect : NaCl , AgBr(common in both defects) , KCl, NaBr
        <br> r+ ≈ r-

        <br><br> (b) <b>Frenkel defect</b> : Its a type of Interstitial defect in <u>Ionic solids</u> , in this cations (mostly) leaves their lattice points
        <br> and occupies voids , it occurs when difference between size of cations and anions is quite large and cations 
        <br>cannot take this difference and they migrate.
        <br>This <u>doesnt changes density</u>.Its also called <b>dislocation defect</b>.
        <br> Examples of solids showing this defect: ZnS, AgCl, AgBr, and AgI
        <br> r+ << r-
    </li><br>
    <img src="../files/images/Schottky defect and Frenkel defect.jpg" width="40%">
    <br><br><li><b>Non-Stoichiometric defect</b> have two types:-
    <br> (a) <b>Metal excess defect</b> : In this Cations becomes excess , In this defect cations from surroundings takes away anions from lattice
    <br>and leaves their electrons there to replace anions.
    <br> Compounds like NaCl and KCl shows this defects in presence of heat and their respective cation vapours.
    <br> Net charge doesnt changes , but <u>density decreases</u>.
    <br> The anion's vacant places are callef <u>F-centers</u>
    <br> Due to this defect , <u>NaCl turns yellow , KCl turns violet ,ZnO turns yellow and LiCl turns pink.</u>
    <br><br><img src="../files/images/metal excess defect.jpg">
    <br><br> (b) <b>Metal deficient defect</b> :  It can occur when a Metal ion can show multiple valancies , eg Fe<sup>+2</sup> being replaced by Fe<sup>+3</sup>,
    <br>for every 2 Fe<sup>+3</sup> one Fe<sup>+2</sup> will go missing to maintain net charge in substance.
    <br> This <u>decreases density</u> and changes Molecular formula.
    <br> eg, Fe<sub>0.93</sub>O means in every 100 Fe<sup>+2</sup> sites 7 will be found missing , why that happaned ? Fe<sup>+3</sup> replaced them. 
    </li>
    
    <br><br><img src="../files/images/Metal deficient defect.png" width="40%">
    <br>

 <li>Solve The following question to understand Metal deficient defect better.
<br>(Q) Find % of Fe<sup>+2</sup>and Fe<sup>+3</sup> in Fe<sub>0.93</sub>O.
<br>Ans. Fe<sup>+3</sup> = 1400&frasl;93 % ,Fe<sup>+2</sup> = 7900&frasl;93 %   
 </li> 
    
</ul>
